# GitHub for Brown

GitHub Education is an Enterprise level GitHub service for managing source code and teams of collaborators on source code. 

## Documentation
This repo is to provide new users with some documentation to help them get familiar with the Brown University GitHub organization. It may be updated from time to time to reflect and changes. It is a public repo, and users may suggest changes to it just like any other GitHub repo.

## GitHub Account

If you **don't** already have a GitHub account, you can join using this link: [GitHub Join](https://github.com/join)

GitHub's accounts are globally unique to GitHub. Your **Brown ShortID** may **not** be available on GitHub. This is **OK**. Since you will be authenticating via Brown's Shibboleth what name you have on GitHub won't really matter. Your Shibboleth login authenticate you.

You may already have a GitHub account for personal or non-Brown related code work. You may use this for Brown's GitHub access as well. Brown does **not** have any special access to other projects on GitHub. 

## Learn Git and GitHub

If you are not already familiar with git and GitHub, Brown has access to several excellent online courses at [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).

Here are 2 to get you started:

* [Learning GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github/version-control-and-collaboration-with-github) - 2hrs 11min: Includes bare basics of using git.  
* [GitHub Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/github-essential-training) - 2hrs 48min: Covers CI concepts and more advanced git usage.

## Understanding Visibility

GitHub is built on an Open Source philosophy where repositories are meant to be **open to public view** unless specified otherwise. This is important to understand when using GitHub.com's services. Brown *strongly* recommends using private repositories until you and your team are comfortable enough with software development practices that you will not be exposing any sensitive information. Sensitive information in this context could include (but not limited to):

- Passwords
- Encryption keys
- Access keys
- Service account credentials
- Proprietary software (not open source)
- User data

### Types of repositories

* **Public** - Visible to the world to view, even without Brown credentials
* **Internal** - Visible to anyone with Brown credentials and GitHub access (needs both)
* **Private** - Hidden to all unless explicitly allowed (teams and individuals)

Visibility does not mean writable. Write access to a repo is managed in each repo's settings by the owner, usually the person who created it. That person would be able to invite users or teams and determine what level of access they would have.

## License

GitHub is built on providing tools for Open Source projects. To this end it provides Open Source compatible licenses to new repositories. As a Brown employee or faculty member these may not be appropriate for the code you are developing. 

### Existing code

If you are modifying an **existing** code that is already under an Open Source license, you should abide by the terms of that license. Normally if that code is used only internally to your team or department then you will not have to worry about it's distribution clauses. If you are sharing the code with a larger audience, please read and understand the conditions of the license the code is under.

### New code

If you are **creating** new code you should leave the license as None for now, until Brown provides an appropriate license.
