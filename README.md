# GitHub for Brown

GitHub Education is an Enterprise level GitHub service for managing source code and teams of collaborators on source code. 

## Documentation
This repo is to provide new users with some documentation to help them get familiar with the Brown University GitHub organization. It may be updated from time to time to reflect and changes. It is a public repo, and users may suggest changes to it just like any other GitHub repo.

## GitHub Account

If you **don't** already have a GitHub account, you can join using this [Brown Join](https://github.com/orgs/BrownUniversity/sso/sign_up) link

GitHub's accounts are globally unique to GitHub. Your **Brown ShortID** may **not** be available on GitHub. This is **OK**. Since you will be authenticating via Brown's Shibboleth what name you have on GitHub won't really matter. Your Shibboleth login authenticate you.

You may already have a GitHub account for personal or non-Brown related code work. You may use this for Brown's GitHub access as well. Brown does **not** have any special access to other projects on GitHub. 

## Learn Git and GitHub

If you are not already familiar with git and GitHub, Brown has access to several excellent online courses at [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/).

Here are 2 to get you started:

[Learning GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-github/version-control-and-collaboration-with-github) - 2hrs 11min: Includes bare basics of using git.
[GitHub Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/github-essential-training) - 2hs 48min: Covers CI concepts and more advanced git usage.

## License

GitHub is built on providing tools for Open Source projects. To this end it provides Open Source compatible licenses to new repositories. As a Brown employee or faculty member these may not be appropriate for the code you are developing. 

### Existing code

If you are modifying an **existing** code that is already under an Open Source license, you should abide by the terms of that license. Normally if that code is used only internally to your team or department then you will not have to worry about it's distribution clauses. If you are sharing the code with a larger audience, please read and understand the conditions of the license the code is under.

### New code

If you are **creating** new code you should leave the license as None for now, until Brown provides an appropriate license.
